# UnoJoy for Guitars

UnoJoy! allows you to easily turn an Arduino Uno (or Mega or Leonardo) into a PS3-compatible USB game controller.

However, this fork has `Unojoy.c` modified for use with a 573 or Guitar Hero (GH) controller. To use this fork, simply follow instructions from the original Unojoy's GitHub and enjoy!
